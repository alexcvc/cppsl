Another C++ support library.
============================

cppsl is a C++ implementation based on my previous support libraries and adapted for C++11. The libraries will be refactored. All classes currently supported from the standard library will be removed. Other improvements such as tests and the typical cmake project will also be added.
The library will include classes which may be implemented in C++20, 23 and are not currently supported by the existing compilers. It is about ARM compilers too.


## C++ Version

Currently, all codes use C++20 

## Target

```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/app/lib
```
