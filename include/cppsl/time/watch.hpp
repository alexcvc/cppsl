 *
 * -  Reset() : Resets the stopwatch to its initial state.
 * -  Go() : Starts the stopwatch and returns the current time point.
 * -  Stop() : Stops the stopwatch and records the stop time point.
 * -  ElapsedTime() : Returns the elapsed time between the start and stop points.
 *
 * The class also has a protected enum called  State , which represents the current state of the stopwatch (idle, running, or stopped). Additionally, there is a static member function called  CurrentTime()  that returns the current time point using the specified duration.

/**
 * The C++ template class "TimerWatch" extends the functionality of a StopWatch. It introduces an additional
 * feature called a "lap" function, which allows for tracking multiple intervals of time.
 * The template parameter, "duration," is used to define the unit of time measurement.
 *
 * The TimerWatch class inherits from the StopWatch class and includes the necessary type aliases for the clock
 * and time_point types. It also inherits the State enum from the StopWatch class.
 *
 * The TimerWatch class provides the following member functions:
 * -  IsElapsed() : Checks if the elapsed time has exceeded the specified timeout duration.
 * -  Timeout() : Returns a constant reference to the timeout duration.
 * -  SetTimeout() : Sets the timeout duration to the specified value.
 *
 * Additionally, the TimerWatch class has a private member variable called  m_timeout , which represents the
 * deadline duration for the TimerWatch.
 * Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

 * "clock" and "time_point" are aliases for the clock and time_point types from the "StopWatch" class.
 * The "State" alias is for the "State" enum from the "StopWatch" class.
 *
 * The class also has a nested struct called "LapDurations" which contains two durations: "total_time" and "split_time".
 *
 * The class provides a method called "StoreLap" which stores the lap durations if the clock state is running.
 * The lap durations are calculated by subtracting the previous lap's total time from the current total time.
 * The lap durations are then stored in a vector.
 *
 * The class also provides a method called "Reset" which clears the vector of lap durations.
 * Lastly, the class has a method called "Laps" which returns a const reference to the vector of lap durations.
